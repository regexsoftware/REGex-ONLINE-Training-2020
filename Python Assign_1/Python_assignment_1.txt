Ques 1: What is JPython & CPython?
Sol: Jython is an implementation of the python programming language that can run on the java platform. Jython programs use java classes instead of python modules. jython compiles into java 
     byte code, which can then be run by java virtual machine. jython is slow as compared to Cpython.
     Cpython is written in c language. Cpython compiles the python source code into intermediate bytecode, which is executed by the Cpython virtual machine. 
     

Ques 2: Basic difference between Python2 & Python3
sol:      Basis of comparison         python3                   		   python2
           Release Date                2008					     2000
           Function print	      print("hello") 				 print"hello"
           Division of integer	     Whenever two integer are divide,            When two integer are divide,
       				     you get a float value   			 you always provide integer value 
            Unicode    		     store string is Unicode 			 define then with "u" 
                                       

Ques 3: Difference between ASCII & Unicode.
sol:   ASCII defines 128 characters, which map to the numbers 0–127. Unicode defines (less than) 221characters, which, similarly, map to numbers 0–221 (though not all 
       numbers are currently assigned, and some are reserved).
       Unicode is a superset of ASCII, and the numbers 0–128 have the same meaning in ASCII as they have in Unicode. For example, the number 65 means "Latin capital 'A'".
       Because Unicode characters don't generally fit into one 8-bit byte, there are numerous ways of storing Unicode characters in byte sequences, such as UTF-32 and UTF-8.
       C follows ASCII and Java follows UNICODE.

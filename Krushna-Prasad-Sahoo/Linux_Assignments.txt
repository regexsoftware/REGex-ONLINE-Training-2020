1. The 'useradd' command is used for creating new user. The variables defined in 
   '/etc/default/useradd' file causes the command to produce other files. The command 
    also reads the content of the '/etc/login.defs' file, which contains configuration 
    for the shadow  password suite such as password expiration policy, ranges of user IDs
    used when creating system and regular users and more. This command adds an entry to the 
    '/etc/passwd', '/etc/shadow', '/etc/group' and '/etc/gshadow' files.

2. The command for creating multiple subdirectories inside any directory using a single 
   mkdir command is : 
   # mkdir -p car/{audi/headlight , bmw/dashboard , peugeot/tail_light }/wheels
   This will create a parent directory 'car' inside which 3 subdirectories 
   'audi' , 'bmw' , 'peugeot' will be created . Inside them 'headlight' , 'dashboard' &
   'tail_light' subdirectories will be created respectively. And the last directory 'wheels'
   will be created inside just previous subdirectories.

3. 'tac' command is used to concatenate and print files in reverse. This command writes the
   file to standard output as showing the last line first and so on.
   'cat' command is also used for the same purpose as 'tac' like showing the contents of 
   file , concatenation , overwrite etc but not in reverse order. It gives output in forward
   direction.

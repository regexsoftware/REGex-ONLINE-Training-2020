Q-1) When we create a user, some hidden files are generated in the directory of the same user at that time. How is it done?
Ans ->  The /etc/skel directory contains files and directories that are automatically copied over to a new user's home directory when such user is created by the useradd 
	program.
	Several user configuration files are placed in /etc/skel by default when the operating system is installed. Typically they might include .bash_profile, .bashrc, 
	.bash_logout, dircolors, .inputrc and .vimrc.
	The Home Directory has the following hidden files:
		->System Settings:
			->Configuration files
			->User Profiles
			->Desktop Environment Settings
		->Application Configuration Profiles:
			->Configuration files for applications
			->Web browser data
			->Caches
			->Logs

Q-2) Make sub directories inside a parent directory by using single mkdir command:
Ans ->	mkdir -p A/B/C

Q-3) Why user folder is not created in by using useradd command?
Ans ->  When a user is created using useradd command, no shell is allocated to that user, so for the folder of the user to be created, one need to first create user 
	using useradd and the after assigning a password by in the /etc/passwd file.

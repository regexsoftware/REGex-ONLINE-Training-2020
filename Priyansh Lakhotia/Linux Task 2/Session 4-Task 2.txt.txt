Ques 1: How can you change the umask value permanently ?

Ans 1: This can be achived by writing a new Umask value in your shell’s configuration file (~/.bashrc for Bash) or in the /etc/profile file.


Ques 2:Add a new user without using adduser or useradd commands

Step 1:Add an entry for the user in /etc/passwd file.
Step 2:Add an entry for the group in /etc/group file.
Step 3:Create the home directory for the added user.

Ques 3:Can we change the UMASK value to 0888?

Ans 3: No we cannot change the value of UMASK to 0888 because the maximum value of UMASK can be 0777.
Even if we try to do so than we will get the following error:

priya@ubuntu:~$ umask 0888
bash: umask: 0888: octal number out of range
priya@ubuntu:~$ 



Ques 4: New user with unique user id
Ans 4: We can create new user with unique userid with ‘-u‘ option. For example, the following command will create a user ‘superuser‘ with custom userid ‘888‘. 
And also we can verify the user with the command cat /etc/passwd | grep superuser.
Code:

priya@ubuntu:~$ sudo -i
[sudo] password for priya: 
root@ubuntu:~# useradd -u 888 superuser
root@ubuntu:~# cat /etc/passwd | grep superuser
superuser:x:888:1003::/home/superuser:/bin/sh
root@ubuntu:~#

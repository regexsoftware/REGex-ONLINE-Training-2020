Task 1

Ques: Why a directory of username is not created when we run the command '$ useradd username' in the home whereas it is created when we use the command '$ adduser username' ?

Ans: By default 'useradd' command creates a user's home directory under /home directory with username.


The useradd program has been deprecated in favor of adduser. From man useradd:
useradd is a low level utility for adding users. Administrators should usually use adduser instead.

adduser is a friendlier frontend to useradd and will do things like create user directories by default. When you run it with only a username as an argument, you will be prompted to provide additional information such as the password

In general, you should always use adduser instead of useradd since this will also set up the required groups automatically. As explained in man adduser:

"adduser  and  addgroup  add users and groups to the system according to command    line    options    and    configuration information in /etc/adduser.conf.   They  are  friendlier  front ends to the low level tools like useradd, groupadd and usermod programs, by default  choosing Debian  policy conformant UID and GID values, creating a home directory with skeletal configuration, running a custom script,  and  other  features.

      vowels=vowels+1
print("Number of vowels are:",vowel)

3)find out the area of the triangle . you have to take the value from the user about the base and the height.

b=int(input("enter the base of the triangle=))
print("area of the traingle is=",(1/2)*b*h)
 4) to print the calender of the given year.

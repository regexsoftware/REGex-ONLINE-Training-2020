# Ques1 : Write a Program to print new list which contains all the first Characters of strings present in a list
        # LIST_STATES = ["GOA","RAJASTHAN","KARNATAKA","GUJRAT","MANIPUR","MADHYA PRADESH"]
# Ans : 
List_states = ["GOA","RAJASTHAN","KARNATAKA","GUJRAT","MANIPUR","MADHYA PRADESH"]

# Ques2 : Write a program to replace each string with an integer value in a given list of strings.
        # The replacement integer value should be a sum of AScci values of each character of type corresponding string.
        # LIST: ['GAnga', 'Tapti', 'Kaveri', 'Yamuna', 'Narmada' ]
# Ans :
given_list = ['GAnga', 'Tapti', 'Kaveri', 'Yamuna', 'Narmada']

# Ques3 : You have to run your Program at 9:00am. Date: 14th April 2020.
        ### HINT:
        # You have to use datetime Module or time module.
        # You have to convert your output in #LIST_FORMAT
        # [ '2020-04-13' , '17:11:01.952975' ]
        # you can use this with the help of IF/Else statement
# Ans :
from datetime import datetime
from threading import Timer

x = datetime.today()

date = datetime.strptime('2020-04-14',"%Y-%m-%d")
y = date.replace(hour=9, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

delta_t = y - x

secs = delta_t.seconds + 1

# Ques4 : GIve a tuple:
        # tuple = ('a','l','g','o','r','i','t','h','m')
        # 1. Using the concept of slicing, print the whole tuple
        # 2. delete the element at the 3rd Index, print the tuple.
# Ans : 

    # 1.
given_tuple = ('a','l','g','o','r','i','t','h','m')
print(given_tuple[::])

    # 2. -> We can't delete the 3rd indexed element from the tuple as TUPLES ARE IMMUTABLE (i.e, we can't change it's contents).



# Ques5: Take a list REGex=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,77,44,15,33,65,89,12]
        # - print only those numbers greator then 20
        # - then print those numbers those are less then 10 or equal to 10
        # - store these above two list in two different list.
# Ans:

# Ques6 : Execute standard LINUX Commands using Python Programming.
# Ans: We can execute any LINUX Command using python by using the following -
    
import os 

os.system('command to execute')

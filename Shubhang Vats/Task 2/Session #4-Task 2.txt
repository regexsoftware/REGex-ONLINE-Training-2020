Ques 3:Can we change the UMASK value to 0888?

Ans 3: No we cannot change the value of UMASK to 0888 because maximum value of UMASK can be 0777.
if we try to do so than we will get the following error:

shubhangvats@ubuntu:~$ umask 0888
bash: umask: 0888: octal number out of range
shubhangvats@ubuntu:~$ 



Ques 4: New user with unique user id
Ans 4: We can create new user with unique userid with ‘-u‘ option. For example, the following command will create a user ‘superuser‘ with custom userid ‘888‘. 
And also we can verify the user with the command cat /etc/passwd | grep superuser.
Code:

shubhangvats@ubuntu:~$ sudo -i
[sudo] password for shubhangvats: 
root@ubuntu:~# useradd -u 888 superuser
root@ubuntu:~# cat /etc/passwd | grep superuser
superuser:x:888:1003::/home/superuser:/bin/sh
root@ubuntu:~#

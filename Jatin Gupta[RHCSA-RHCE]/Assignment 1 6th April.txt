1) When we create a user, some hidden files are generated in the directory of the same user at that time. How is it done ?

Ans.  It is done because these files are in the folder /etc/skel and whichever files we place in this folder those files will be 
	made available in the home directory of all the users which we create afterwards.
	For reference following are some commands to create a file in /etc/skel and creating and listing files in /home/user
	files 
	-> cd /etc/root
	-> touch TestFile
	-> useradd RedhatUser
	-> ls /home/RedhatUser
	Now you'll find the TestFile document in this folder which is the proof that whichever files we put in the folder
	/etc/skel will be available to all the users created after it.


2) Make sub directories inside a parent directory by using single mkdir command.
 
Ans.  mkdir  -p  A/B/C (-p for parent directoy option).

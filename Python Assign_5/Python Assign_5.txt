1. Hint:
   -> Make a use of Time Module and for Loop
   -> Output Should be :
   Loading.
   Loading..
   Loading...
   Loading....
   Loading.....
   Here it shows you 5 output but you have to print only "Loading....." in animated form.
Sol : import time
      print("Loading",end="")
      for i in range(5):
          print(".",end="")
          time.sleep(2)

2. Difference between Return and Yield ?
Sol : Return is the financial gain or loss on an investment and is typically expressed as the change in
      dollar value of an investment over time. Return is also referred to as total return and expresses 
      what an investor earned from an investment during a certain period. Total return includes interest,
      dividends, and capital gain, such as an increase in the share price. In other words, a return is 
      retrospective, or backward-looking.
      Yield is the income returned on an investment, such as the interest received from holding a security.
      The yield is usually expressed as an annual percentage rate based on the investment's cost, current
      market value, or face value. Yield may be considered known or anticipated depending on the security 
      in question, as certain securities may experience fluctuations in value.

	       :09
	       :10
	       :11
  	       :12
Sol : import time

      for i in range(5):
          a=str(time.ctime())
          b=a.split(" ")
          print(b[3])
          time.sleep(1)

4. Add anything in tuple.. example: (1,2,3,4) -> new tuple (1,2,3,4,5)
Sol : t=(1,2,3,4)
      print(t)
      t=t+(5,)
      print(t)

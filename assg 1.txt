assignment :

1) Change the Umask value for any user permanently

solution-To do that, write a new Umask value in your shell’s configuration file (~/.bashrc for Bash) or in the /etc/profile file.

That’s it! From now on, any new file or folder that you create on your Linux system will have that exact set of permissions.

 However, please keep in mind that the permissions of existing files and folders will not be changed by the above action.

If you are used to the command-line, you can see the current permissions of files by running the ls -lah command in any directory you want.

 for example -  vim /home/username/.bashrc then type umask (eg: 024) save and quit then vim /home/username/.bash_profile and type umask(eg:024)
 save and quit then check umask for that user



2)  add a new user  without using adduser & useradd command

solution- If create user using useradd command in Ubuntu it don't allocate the shell for that user.

First of all create user using useradd in Ubuntu than
If you run vim /etc/passwd command than you got the answer



3) Can we change the Umask value to 0888.
If yes, then how. If no then why ?

solution- It cannot be done right because the maximum umask value itself is 777



4)  how to add a new user with a Unique user id (e.g 1345) & check out the unique Id of that user.

solution- In Linux, every user has its own UID (Unique Identification Number). By default, whenever we create a new user accounts in Linux, it assigns userid 500, 501, 502 and so on…

But, we can create user’s with custom userid with ‘-u‘ option. For example, the following command will create a user ‘jitsaa‘ with custom userid ‘999‘.

[root@kirti~]# useradd -u 999 jitsaa

To verify that the user created with a defined userid (999) using following command.

[root@kirti ~]# cat /etc/passwd | grep jitsaa

jitsaa:x:999:999::/home/jitsaa:/bin/bash




5) How to change the group of any folder

solution- Change the group owner of a file by using the chgrp command.
   
   5(a) After this checkout the group name of the files present in that folder.

solution-  sudo chgrp (groupname) (filename)

   5(b)  Try to change the group of the folder & the files present in the same folder using a single command

solution-   sudo chgrp -R groupname filename.



6) When we create a user, some hidden files are generated in the directory of the same user at that time. How is it done ?

solution - In computing, a hidden folder (sometime hidden directory) or hidden file is a folder or file which filesystem utilities do not display by default when showing a directory listing. 
They are commonly used for storing user preferences or preserving the state of a utility, and are frequently created implicitly by using various utilities. 
They are not a security mechanism because access is not restricted - usually the intent is simply to not "clutter" the display of the contents of a directory listing with files the 
user did not directly create.


7)  Make sub directories inside a parent directory by using single mkdir command (refer figure given below)
solution -  The command you are looking for is mkdir -p x/y/z. The -p switch create parents directories.

~$ mkdir -p d/s/a/e
~$ cd d/s/a/e/
~/d/s/a/e$ 
or it can be simply done by
Use the -p option. Your command should be:

sudo mkdir -p x/y/z.

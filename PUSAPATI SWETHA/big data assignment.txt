Q)differences between hadoop1 and hadoop2.

hadoop1:* it has map reduce
*it has job tracker and task tracker
*In Hadoop 1, there is HDFS which is used for storage and top of it, 
 Map Reduce which works as Resource Management as well as Data Processing.
 Due to this workload on Map Reduce, it will affect the performance
*Hadoop 1 is a Master-Slave architecture. It consists of a single master and multiple slaves. 
Suppose if master node got crashed then irrespective of your best slave nodes, your cluster will be destroyed. 
Again for creating that cluster means copying system files, image files, etc. on another system is too much time consuming which will not be tolerated by organizations in todayâ€™s time.


hadoop2:*it has YARN
*it has resource manager and node manager
*In Hadoop 2, there is again HDFS which is again used for storage and on the top of HDFS, there is YARN which works as Resource Management. 
It basically allocates the resources and keeps all the things going on.
*Hadoop 2 is also a Master-Slave architecture. But this consists of multiple masters (i.e active namenodes and standby namenodes) and multiple slaves. 
If here master node got crashed then standby master node will take over it. You can make multiple combinations of active-standby nodes. 
Thus Hadoop 2 will eliminate the problem of a single point of failure.


Q) why hadoop has block of 128 mb

 minimize the cost of seek and reduce the meta data information generated per block.


Q)why does name node rely on memory
The namenode keeps all of the filesystem layout information (files, blocks, directories, permissions, etc) and the block locations. 
The filesystem layout is persisted on disk and the block locations are kept solely in memory

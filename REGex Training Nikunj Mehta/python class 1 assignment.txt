Q1. what is JPython & CPython?
ans1.JPython is an implementation of the Python programming language designed to run on the Java platform. The implementation was formerly known as JPython until 
     1999.
     CPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming language. Written in C and Python, CPython is the default and most widely used implementation
     of the language.

Q2.Basic diff. b/w python2 & python3?
ans2. Python 2 made code development process easier than earlier versions. It implemented technical details of Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP).
      Python released version 3.0. This version was mainly released to fix problems which exist in Python 2. The nature of these change is such that Python 3 was 
      incompatible with Python 2. It is backward incompatible Some features of Python 3 have been backported to Python 2.x versions to make the migration process easy 
      in Python 3.
Q3. Diff. b/w ASCII & UNICODE?
ans3. ASCII originally used seven bits to encode each character. This was later increased to eight with Extended ASCII to address the apparent inadequacy of the 
      original.
      Unicode uses a variable bit encoding program where you can choose between 32, 16, and 8-bit encodings. Using more bits lets you use more characters at the 
      expense of larger files while fewer bits give you a limited choice but you save a lot of space.

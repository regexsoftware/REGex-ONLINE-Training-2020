1) Find the Armstrong Number between the two numbers which are input by user?
		Armstrong number : 153 -> 1*1*1 + 5*5*5 + 3*3*3
Ans.  n = int(input("Enter any no. : "))
	temp = n
	sum = 0
	while (n > 0):
    		r = n % 10
    		sum = sum + (r*r*r)
    		n = n//10

	if sum == temp:
    		print("Number is armstrong")
	else:
    		print("Number is not armstrong")



2) Let’s say you have a string “hello this world @2020!!! ”
		Remove the punctuation like [“@!#$%&*()”] from the string
		Final output should be without the punctuation
			“hello this world 2020”

Ans. s = "hello this world @2020!!!"
     	for i in range(len(s)):
          	if ((s[i] >= 'a' and s[i] <= 'z') or (s[i] >= '0' and s[i] <= '9') or (s[i] == ' ')):
        		print(s[i],end="")



3) You have a list with words - [“Apple”, “banana”, “cat”, “REGEX”,”apple”]
  	Sort words in Alphabetical order
	If you get output, like [Apple, apple, banana]
	How has it happened?

Ans.	l = ['Apple', 'banana', 'cat', 'REGEX','apple']
	l.sort()
	print(l)
